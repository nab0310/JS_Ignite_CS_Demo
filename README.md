## Lession

### Beginner
Write functions for the subtract, multiply, divide, and power (exponent) operations. As the functions are added the operations will be added to the dropdown in the calculator.

```javascript
subtract(2, 1) // returns 1
multiply(2, 1) // returns 2
divide(2, 1) // returns 2
power(2, 0) // returns 1
```

### Intermediate
Create a round function which rounds the results. The round function will be called with the result of a computation and will return the rounded form of it.  

```javascript
round(5.11111111) // returns 5 or 5.11
```

### Advanced
Write a parseNumber function that parses regular function that parses numbers and percents.

```javascript
parseNumber("3") // returns 3
parseNumber("3.5") // returns 3.5
parseNumber("30%") // returns 0.3
```
